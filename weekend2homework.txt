Weekend homework: 
# Requirements

Apply all the learning of the last two weeks to produce an OO-designed application that models the operations of a hotel chain.

We're going to need to model individual hotels, and their rooms -- they can have single or double-rooms.

Guests need to check in, and check out at the end of their stays.

It should go without saying that we need to make sure we don't double-book rooms, or over-fill hotels.

The management are going to need reporting on the occupancy, and the revenue (assuming rooms have rates? or at least a standard rate single/double) for the day.

All of this needs to be driven through a smooth UI (command line, of course!), which tries to prevent invalid data from the user from causing any problems.


Does your design allow us to predict what the availability will be on a given day in the future? If not, what sort of amount of word is needed to support it? Would you need any different models?
